### **Project Breakdown**


**Problem Statement**
To create a platform where the artists, stakeholders, collectors and the general public generalize the usage of the Web 3 technology from their day-to-day life and expanding their horizon to considering blockchain as just shares where they buy and sell when it's profitable.

**How ChainzCommerce Works**

- **View Purchased NFTs**: See a list of NFTs that you have purchased or own.
- **Create NFTs**: Easily create and mint new NFTs, defining their attributes and metadata.

## **Future Prospects and Conclusion**


1. What are the potential future features or enhancements you envision for your project?
   - We are planning to make a AR and VR exhibition museum o showcase the artistic NFTs to make it inline with the  Metaverse theme.
   - We will be making it a full-fledged E-Commerce website which enables users to purchase day to day things.
   - We will be also adding an ML model which will track the price of the blockchains and currency plus the gas fees which can predict the future rates to allow users make profitable decisions.
2. How do you plan to scale the project if there's an increase in user activity or data volume?
   - We'll add it to a database, more specifically a Web 3 based storage provider.
3. Provide a concise one-line summary of your proposal and its objectives.
   - Our project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to interact with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The application provides functionality to view purchased NFTs, create new NFTs, and explore a list of available NFTs with added benefits.
